## Guidelines
When refactoring the code, please follow these principles:

1. **Maintain Functionality**: The refactored code must provide the same functionality as the original.

2. **Follow SOLID Principles**:
   - Single Responsibility: Each class/function should have one reason to change
   - Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
   - Liskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
   - Interface Segregation: Clients shouldn't depend on methods they don't use
   - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

3. **Improve Code Quality**:
   - Reduce code duplication
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
   - Break down complex methods into smaller, focused ones
   - Remove unused code and imports
   - Add appropriate comments and documentation

4. **Apply Design Patterns** where appropriate:
   - Consider repository pattern for data access
   - Use dependency injection for better testability
   - Apply factory or builder patterns for complex object creation
   - Consider strategy pattern for variant behaviors

5. **Enhance Error Handling**:
   - Use custom exceptions where appropriate
   - Implement proper try/catch blocks
   - Provide meaningful error messages

6. **Optimize Performance** where possible:
   - Identify and fix performance bottlenecks
   - Optimize database queries
   - Consider caching strategies

## Output Format
Please provide the complete refactored code with explanations of key changes and the reasoning behind them. Include a summary of improvements made.

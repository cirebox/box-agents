# Frontend Development Task

## Feature
{{feature}}

## Components to Create
{{components}}

## Requirements
{{requirements}}

## Technical Guidelines
- Use React with Next.js framework
- Implement TypeScript for type safety
- Use functional components with React Hooks
- Implement proper form validation
- Use responsive design principles
- Follow accessibility best practices (WCAG)
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Use the project's component architecture
- Follow the project's state management approach

## Component Architecture
Each component should follow these principles:
- Single responsibility principle
- Proper prop typing with TypeScript
- Separation of concerns (UI rendering vs. logic)
- Use of custom hooks for reusable logic
- Proper handling of side effects

## Styling Approach
- Use CSS modules or styled-components based on the project standards
- Follow responsive design principles
- Ensure consistent spacing and layout
- Follow the project's design system for colors, typography, etc.

## Error Handling
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Implement proper form validation feedback
- Handle network errors gracefully
- Show loading states during asynchronous operations

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize rendering where necessary
- Use memoization for expensive computations
- Lazy load components when appropriate
- Consider code splitting for larger features

## Expected Output
Please provide:
1. Component implementation with TypeScript and proper typing
2. Any necessary custom hooks
3. Styling implementation
4. Form validation logic (if applicable)
5. API integration code (if applicable)
6. Brief documentation explaining component usage and props
